# POTA Local Parks Progress

POTA Local Parks Progress is a simple Python script that queries the Parks on the Air API to find your closest parks,
prints them in a list starting from the closest, and includes the status of whether you have activated them yet or not.

## What?

[Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) is an Amateur Radio activity where radio operators set up portable
stations in country parks, nature reserves, etc. to enjoy the great outdoors alongside their hobby.

There is a set list of parks world-wide which count for the program, which is regularly updated to include new locations
by a team of volunteers.

"Activating" a park consists of going there, setting up a portable radio station, and making at least 10 contacts with
other radio stations around the world, following the [POTA Rules](https://docs.pota.app/docs/rules.html).

This software helps POTA activators keep track of their progress through their local parks, find the closest park they
haven't activated yet, etc.

## Usage

Usage with `venv` and `pip` on Linux is recommended, but it will work fine wherever you use Python and however you like
to manage it.

A complete example for Debian & derivatives such as Ubuntu is included below. On the line where the script runs:

```bash
python3 pota-local-progress.py <num_parks> <callsign> <lat> <lon>
```

You will need to set the four command-line arguments appropriately for your query. `numparks` tells the script to
consider this number of parks closest to you. `lat` and `lon` are in decimal degrees, positive East and South, for your
home location. So I might for example run:

```bash
python3 pota-local-progress.py 20 M0TRT 50.71407 -1.87479
```

Here's the complete example:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
git clone https://github.com/ianrenton/pota-local-progress.git
cd newparks
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pota-local-progress.py <num_parks> <callsign> <lat> <lon>
deactivate
```

## Warning

Always do your own research to find out if it is possible and legal to activate a park, regardless of whether it appears
within this software or on the POTA website, and abide by the POTA rules.

This software makes a number of queries to the "public but unofficial" POTA API. It caches the result for one day, to
avoid overloading the servers with repeated requests. Please do not abuse the API by hammering it with an undue number
of requests.
